## 1. Handling Concurrent Booking Requests
### Optimistic Locking:

+ When a user attempts to book an event, the application first retrieves the current state of the event.
+ It checks if the event is available for booking (e.g., not already booked for the same time slot).
+ If the event is available, the application allows the booking and updates the event's status.
+ If the event has already been booked in the meantime, the application will reject the booking attempt and inform the user.

### Pessimistic Locking:

+ Lock the event record when a user initiates a booking request.
+ Other requests for the same event will wait until the lock is released (i.e., the booking process is completed).
+ This can lead to lower concurrency but ensures that only one booking can be processed at a time for an event.
  
## 2. Implementation Strategy


### Using Optimistic Locking:

#### 1. Retrieve Event Details:
```
const event = await Event.findById(eventId);
```
#### 2. Check Availability:

```
if (event.isBooked) {
    throw new Error('Event already booked.');
}
```
#### 3. Book the Event:

```
event.isBooked = true; // or modify as per your logic
await event.save();
```
#### 4. Error Handling:

+ If saving fails due to a version conflict or any other reason, catch the error and notify the user about the failure.


### Using Pessimistic Locking:

#### 1. Start a Transaction:

```
const session = await mongoose.startSession();
session.startTransaction();
```
#### 2. Lock the Event:
```
const event = await Event.findOne({ _id: eventId }).session(session).lean(false);
```

#### 3. Check and Book:

+ Same as in optimistic locking but within the transaction.
  
#### 4. Commit or Abort Transaction:
```
if (event.isBooked) {
    await session.abortTransaction();
    throw new Error('Event already booked.');
}
event.isBooked = true;
await event.save({ session });
await session.commitTransaction();
```

#### 5. Error Handling:

+ Ensure proper error handling and session cleanup.

Events Table:
```
CREATE TABLE Events (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    isBooked BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    UNIQUE (date) -- Ensures no two events can be booked at the same date and time
);
```
Bookings Table:

```
CREATE TABLE Bookings (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    eventId INT NOT NULL,
    userId INT NOT NULL,
    createdAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    FOREIGN KEY (eventId) REFERENCES Events(id),
    UNIQUE (eventId) -- Prevents double bookings for the same event
);
```
