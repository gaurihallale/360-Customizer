## 1. TypeScript Feature for Return Type:
####  The feature being used to specify the return type of the getUserInfo function is type annotations. Specifically, the function returns a Promise that resolves to an object with properties name (a string) and age (a number). The return type is specified as:
```
Promise<{ name: string; age: number }>
```

## 2. Handling Cases Where age May Be Missing:
#### To handle cases where the API response might be missing the age property, you can make the age field optional by marking it as age?: number. This means that age might be undefined. Here's how you would modify the function:

```
function getUserInfo(userId: number): Promise<{ name: string; age?: number }> {
  return fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`)
    .then(response => response.json());
}
```
