### To optimize the performance of this query, you should consider the following indexes:
## 1. Index on orders(order_date):
#### Since we are filtering by order_date, having an index on this column will speed up the filtering process.

```
CREATE INDEX idx_order_date ON orders(order_date);
```
## 2. Composite Index on orders(user_id, order_date):
#### Since we are also joining based on user_id, creating a composite index on both user_id and order_date will make the query more efficient.
```
CREATE INDEX idx_user_order_date ON orders(user_id, order_date);
```

## 3. Index on orders(user_id):
#### An index on user_id in the orders table will help optimize the join between the users and orders tables.

```
CREATE INDEX idx_order_user_id ON orders(user_id);
```
## 4. Index on users(user_id):
#### Since we are joining users with orders based on user_id, having an index on the user_id column in the users table will help speed up the join process.
#### In PostgreSQL, the primary key automatically has an index, so if user_id is a primary key, this index will already exist. However, if not:
```
CREATE INDEX idx_user_user_id ON users(user_id);
```
